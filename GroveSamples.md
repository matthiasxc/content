#Grove Shield Samples
The Grove Kit is an modular tool set involving a shield that can be installed on the Galileo board and allows plug-and-play capabilities for a wide range of sensors. The Grove Starter Kit Plus has been [tested as compatible](http://ms-iot.github.io/content/ShieldCompat.htm) with Windows on Galileo.

These samples cover the sensors in the Grove starter kit, but there are [dozens of additional sensors](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GROVE_System) that you can use to get your project moving. 

##Grove Kit Samples

[Complete code for the Grove Kit sensors can be found here](https://github.com/IdentityMine/Galileo-Grove-Samples).

The projects were created using a Galileo Gen 2 board, but the bulk of the code (in the Main.cpp files) can be used in a Galileo Gen 1 board.

These samples cover the following Grove input-output sensors:
- LED
- Light Sensor
- Relay (220V)
- Servo
- Sound
- Touch
- Buzzer
- Rotary Angle
- LCD with RGB backlight

##Sample Instructions 
Additional information (like the specifics on how to wire the sensors and how to use the projects) is in the [accompanying blog post](http://blog.identitymine.com/2015/01/19/grove-project-summaries/).
